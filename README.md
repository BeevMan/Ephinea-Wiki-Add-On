# UNOFFICIAL Ephinea Wiki Add-On
  
##### Things I might want to add in the future.  
  
  - Started with ultimate drop tables, eventually add in the other difficulties  
    - Make the difficulty selectable  
    - Change enemy names when ultimate is selected???
	- Does not currently add drops to tables in quests with Random Enemy Spawn Chances.
	- Add in rare monsters

  - Save selected section ID as default, to be used in next page load

  - Editable dar & rar rates to factor in events / HBR boosts

  - Add box drops to quest pages
  
  - Chance an item will drop during the quest & or per floor (when all enemies killed)  
    - Consider making editable kill counts??? (in case you don't want to kill all enemies)  
  
  - Scrape the Wiki's price guide and integrate values into drop tables  
  
  - Add section ID icons to the select element
    - will need to use a library to add images into select element
      - need to use something like https://github.com/bug7a/iconselect.js to display images as options
		  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2965971/how-to-add-images-in-select-list

  - Add a countdown clock for auctions on the forums?



###### Notes

  - Spawning enemies such as Recon - Recobox, Mothmant - Monest.  Need to be edited in the drop chart files.
  - Gillchic is missing it's 2nd l on the official drop charts, that needs to be edited in the drop chart files as well.
	- Saint-Milion vs the scraped "Saint Million" .
