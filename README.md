# Ephinea Wiki Add-On
#### The first objective is to add drop tables to individual [quest pages](https://wiki.pioneer2.net/w/Quests).  

##### Things I might want to add in the future.  
  
  - Will be starting with ultimate drop tables, eventually add in the other difficulties  
  
  - Chance an item will drop during the quest & or per floor (when all enemies killed)  
    - Consider making editable kill counts??? (in case you don't want to kill all enemies)  
  
  - Scrape the Wiki's price guide and integrate values into drop table
